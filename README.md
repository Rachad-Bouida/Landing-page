1. Starting of with working out, around 5 times a week, by going to the gym, playing sports, or by simply running or walking. Don't overload yourself especially in the gym because it may injure youinj

2. It is very important to keep your diet balanced, and that doesn't mean you stop eating fat or take a lot of protein, but you need to fullfil your body's needs from carbs, protein and fat.

3. One of the hardest aspects of working out is motivation, you'll start very motivated, but you start loosing it after some time. Best thing to do in this situation is working out with a friend or make a new friend in the gym!

4. And finaly, don't forget to rest your body so your muscles have time to grow, and by rest I don't mean weeks, like every two or three sessions take a day off, and don't forget to give your body enough sleep.
